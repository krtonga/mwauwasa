    "qn": "Where does my water come from?",
    "ans": "The source of the MWAUWASA water is Lake Victoria. But the water in the lake is not safe.\n\nAt the production site a few chemicals are added to the lake water to make it clear. The water now looks like clean water. But it is not safe to use just yet. After the water is cleared, it is pumped into big basins with sand in it: sand filters. The water sinks slowly to the bottom. Dirt and other particles will stay on top of and in the sand and the water will go through. The quality of the water improves and undesirable bacteria and viruses are made harmless. MWAUWASA than puts a little chlorine in the filtered water to kill all the diseases in it. The lake water is now drinking water and it is stored in big water tanks.\n\nBefore distributing the safe water to the people in Mwanza, MWAUWASA tests the water in the laboratory to make sure the quality is good. After that the lake water, which is now safe water, is transported to the houses of the people in Mwanza City via 561.5 kilometres of pipelines. The final stop of the journey of the water is the water meter at your home. The water meter starts working when you open the tap and use water. The water meter displays how much water you use."

    "qn":"What sewerage services does MWAUWASA provide?",
    "ans": "Poor disposal of wastewater contaminates water sources. That contamination poses a health risk to the people using the water source, thatâ€™s why MWAUWASA manages waste water in Mwanza City before disposing in Lake Victoria.\n\nThe existing sewerage system (wastewater collection) has a length of 85 km consisting of PVC, concrete and steel (diameters DN 150 to DN 600). It serves the Central Business district and some surrounding areas such as Kirumba, Nyamanoro, Kilimahewa, Pasiansi and Igogo. The sewer network is drained by gravity and pumping. The present number of house connections is 3,500. All wastewater collected by the sewerage system is pumped by a Central pump station via a transmission mains (DN 150,DN 400 and DN 800 ) to the existing, treatment plant located in Butuja Ilemela some 6 km north of the City centre."
